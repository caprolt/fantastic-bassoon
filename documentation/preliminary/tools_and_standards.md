## Standards  

* Due to the required artefacts for this  project, the project will be 
managed in a Waterfall-esq style of development.  While it is expected that 
more than one pass will be needed (cyclic adaptation), the software is 
fairly simple and should not require too many repititons.

* Requirements documentation  
  * Will be generated in Markdown
  * Will be converted to Word Documents
  * Will be change-tracked and version controlled via Git
  * Will be numbered by hand (not many changes are expected)

* Design documentation
  * Will be generated in Markdown
  * Will be converted into Word Documents
  * Will be change-tracked and version controlled by Git
  * Will be matched to requirements by hand (the project scope is relatively small)

* Test
